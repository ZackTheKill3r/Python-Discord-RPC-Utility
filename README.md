**How to use it?**
First, download either the compiled release or the Python source code.
and then open the **"settings.py"** file on any text editor like notepad,notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.
and there you will find the link for the Discord Developer Portal, you can find it here as well https://discord.com/developers/applications ;) .
and you just have to create or use an app that you already have there, just copy its **"Application ID"** or **"Client ID"** both should be the same and consequently work the same.
just paste it in between the quotes **""** and you're good to go.
If you need any help you can contact me on my email zackthekill3r@outlook.com or my Discord ZackTheKill3r#2574 .
