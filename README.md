<h2>What is D.R.U?</h2>
Discord RPC Utility. It's an Open Source GUI for making your own RPC's without any code.

<h2>What is RPC?</h2>
It litteraly means "Discord Rich Presence", and it's basically an API for Apps/Games to tell Discord what you're doing
like (Playing Sonic The Hedgehog 2) and give two lines of information.

<h2>Features!</h2>

- 2 Buttons on your profile that lead to custom links
- Two custom lines of text on the playing status

<h2>How to use it?</h2>

First, download either the compiled release or the Python source code.

Then open the **"settings.py"** file on any text editor like notepad,notepad++ or Visual Studio Code.
and there you will find the link for the Discord Developer Portal, you can find it here as well https://discord.com/developers/applications ;) .

Now you just have to create or use an app that you already have there, just copy its **"Application ID"** or **"Client ID"** both should be the same and consequently work the
same.

Just paste it in between the quotes **""** and you're good to go.
